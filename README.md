Code developed during the courses of "Ingegneria Informatica" at the University of Rome "La Sapienza".

Currently I am still a student, so this repo will be constantly updated.

## Skills developed at Cooding Courses (for now)

#### Hard-skills
###### Python3 
Write programs in Python that involve the use of programming techniques and data structures introduced.

###### Models for computer science
- Von Neumannâ€™s architecture
- The representation of information
numerical representations of numbers without sign or numbers with sign, fractional numbers, fixed and floating commas, characters, strings and other data types
- The use of logic in electronic computers in particular propositional logic
- The theory of languages and grammars, in particular regular expressions

#### Soft-skills
###### Knowledge, understanding and problem-solving:
Knowledge of fundamental models of computer science and programming principles.
Understanding the potential and limitations of programming. 
Problem solving through computer models.
Ability to understand the technical complexities in the realization of programs.
Critical analysis of a program and analysis of strengths and weaknesses.

###### Respect guidelines and deadliness
Weekly exercises are assigned to be completed within 2 days. 
These help you to practice with command requests and manage your time (counting the time spent to follow the other courses).
